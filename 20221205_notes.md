starting analysis on shotgun bal data

theres one mistake in sample log -- B22_NaNa was misnames B22_NaDNase so both
reads got put into one. THANKFULLY not a frameshift mistake -- need better 
naming conventions to avoid this mistake in the future

	will omit NaDNase samples--will rerun bcl convert with updated sample sheet
	and add them in toorrow.

	B22_NaDNase     MGX_DATA        /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/reads/B22_NaDNase_S12_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz   /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/reads/B22_NaDNase_S12_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
