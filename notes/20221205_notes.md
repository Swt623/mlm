starting analysis on shotgun bal data

theres one mistake in sample log -- B22_NaNa was misnames B22_NaDNase so both
reads got put into one. THANKFULLY not a frameshift mistake -- need better 
naming conventions to avoid this mistake in the future

	will omit NaDNase samples--will rerun bcl convert with updated sample sheet
	and add them in toorrow.

	B22_NaDNase     MGX_DATA        /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/reads/B22_NaDNase_S12_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz   /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/reads/B22_NaDNase_S12_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

restarting analysis with updated data

python3 workflow/scripts/prep_sample_sheet.py --delimiter="_S" --path="/projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq" --subdirectories=Truefdsa
	reads in ../cat_reads and ended up working for wverything hehe

last time i added a bunch of functionality including bowtie2 alignment etc.
this led to improved efficiency and showed greater host-depletion and taxonomic depth from metaphlan
this led to the conclusion that duplicate reads from adapter dimers are contributing to artificial low alignment in some samples
thus, a read deduplication step is necessary to more robustly 

today, im updating fastp to v0.23.2 in order to use its deduplication functionality 
	activated conda environment with fastp	
	conda update fastp

fastp needs to be optimized with downstream stuff
 fastp -i /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/ds.d2b2785572ed457391fae708169f4be5/B21_LyNa_S77_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -I /projects/p31648/bmo_shotgun_fastq/ds.d2b2785572ed457391fae708169f4be5/B21_LyNa_S77_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz --out1 B21_LyNA.r1.a.fastq.gz --out2 B21_LyNA.r2.a.fastq.gz  --detect_adapter_for_pe --dedup --thread 23 --length_required 50 -j ./B21_LyNa_fastp.json -h ./B21_LyNa_fastp.html -V --overrepresentation_analysis -g --merge --merged_out B21_LyNA.merged.a.fastq.gz --low_complexity_filter --include_unmerged --correction

and then include -U merged + unpaired in the bowtie mapping

starting to test the other components

fastp > bowtie2 etc. finished up yesterday wit dedup except B21_LyDNase needs more memory 

one liner for flagstat
	cd into bowtie_out directory
	for i in $(ls -d *) ; do sed -e "s/^/$i\t/" ${i}/*.flagstat.tsv >> tmp.txt ; done
