command i used to make the sample sheet

python3 workflow/scripts/prep_sample_sheet.py --delimiter="_" --r1_common="_1" --r2_common="_2" --path="../cat_reads"
	reads in ../cat_reads and ended up working for wverything hehe

noticed that NTM00399 did assemble, which i noted in my rotation report that it didnt... maybe there were just too few assemblies
	on the same note, two samples are taking quite a long time: NTM00262, NTM00067

had to delete snakemamba conda and reinstall w code in documentation. i think it became too bloated w all my mlms but not sure

	with that new install, i also had to update snakemake cause kept getting a snakemake error. 7.3.8>7.18

noticed snakemake stalls at dropping short contigs script + no python gives Biopython not recocgnized error -> biopython not installed?

	found which conda env it is w/ "snakemake -n --list-conda-envs"
	activated it with minipython and tested parse_contigs function --> it worked, so prob not the install
	means prob a problem with snakemake?? maybe path?
	i think it may be tht there are issues in calling the correct python environment for the "script" execute in snakemake...
	...maybe try installing in snakemamba 
	did conda install -c bioconda biopython=1.78 in snakemamba env
	WOO this seemed to have worked...but why didnt snakemake work og?

noticed map2contigs wasnt working after dropping short contigs started working	
	in the rule description, "mem=<>" was blank since god knows when...
	set it to be 25G

also, deleting NTM00262, NTM00067 from sample sheet
